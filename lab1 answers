1. I used replit
2.I typed in the code and the output is 

sh -c make -s
./main
orange county community college
lab1
x + y =25


After deleting the semi colan it did not compile and received a syntax error

4.after placing the semi colan again it compiled correctly

5.after modifying the code i was able to see the values of x and y and the end result was 

sh -c make -s
./main
orange county community college
lab1
content of x right after initialization: 20
x + y =25
content of y right after program exit: 5

6.after commenting out the cout statements the values of x and y were not visible during the execution
